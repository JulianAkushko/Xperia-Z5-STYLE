#####Xperia Z5 S.T.Y.L.E. 4.5 features:

- Based on the latest Xperia Z1 Compact deodexed base by @Gaurav007, with **SuperUserMod** and **ZipAlign**.
- Implemented with a bunch of updated Sony Xperia Z5 apps, such as Camera, Weather, Contacts, Dialer, some themes, etc.
- **No bloatware**: All unuseful Sony apps were removed. The system has been optimized at it's max.
- **Tweaked**: Some tweaks have been implemented to improve your Lollipop experience, such as TRIM for NAND, ART Tweaks, and zRAM Tweaks.
- You can install Xposed on top of it if you want to. Just Google "Xposed For Lollipop" and follow the steps.
- **Custom ROM OTA Services**: A OTA Update system has been implemented, independent of Sony's FOTA, so that I can send you over there the latest patches and updates of the ROM.
- X-Reality & Bravia Engine 2 come preinstalled to enjoy a better image quality.
