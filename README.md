**Y** - Yeasty,  
**L** - & Lightweight,  
**E** - Z5 Experience  


#####Xperia Z5 S.T.Y.L.E. 4.0 features:

- Stock based, 18.6.A.0.175, **Deodexed** using @Gaurav007's Firmware, **zipaligned** and with **SuperUserMod**.
- Implemented using **ALL XPERIA Z5 APPS** (which weren't considered Bloatware OFC). For example: Z5 Camera 2.0, Weather, Calendar, Contacts, Themes, Dialer, Messaging, Mail, etc.)
- **DEBLOATED**: It's faster than any ROM out there (probably even faster than some UBL Roms), very stable and weights considerably less (Less than 400MB). All the system has been optimized wisely, removing Sony unnecesary apps.
- **TWEAKED**: Implemented with various tweaks, discovered and made by @Miche1asso, to ensure a proper Lollipop experience. For example: GPS Fixes, zRAM tweaks, FStrim to boost your NAND... 
- You can install Xposed if you want to, just flash Rovo89 API22 Xposed flashable Zip and you're ready to go


####Known bugs:
######My APNs are not downloading automatically, what should I do?
Configure them manually... I'll try to fix that for the next one. 

######My screen is not working to touch anymore after flashing the Zip?!?!
That's a Sony's Kernel bug present in all 0x0800 screens, and I can't fix that.
The solution for me is to lock my device, and after 3 seconds, turn the screen back on and it should be working ok again.


##How can I join BETA group?
To join, you can just send me an email to `sergiocastell [at] gmail [dot] com`, or send me a PM.  
  *PS: I won’t reply any email non-related with Beta Program access requests.*  
Since we’re going to work in AndroidFileHost you’ll need to *register* there and then, you'll need to [**_follow_**] me so that I can add you to the Beta group (AFH has been notified, since this is a bug).  
  Of course, you’re not able to redistribute the beta packages, nor share them. If anoyone you know wants to join in, then redirect them here.
